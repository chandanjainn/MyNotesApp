# MyNotesApp
Simple Node.js app to keep notes

Menu driven app to
1.Add a note
2.Delete a note
3.List all notes
4.Get a note by title


Currently just stores the title and content of the note. Add more fields as per your requirements.

#Contains commented code which offers an alternative approach to that functionality.
e.g- Instead of menu driven UI you can use command line arguments to input command,title and content..
