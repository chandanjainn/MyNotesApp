Menu driven app to<br />
1.Add a note<br />
2.Delete a note<br />
3.List all notes<br />
4.Get a note by title<br />

Currently just stores the title and content of the note. Add more fields as per your requirements.

e.g- Instead of menu driven UI you can use command line arguments to input command,title and content..
